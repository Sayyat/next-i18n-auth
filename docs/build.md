Certainly! Here's how your **`build.md`** file could look after adapting it to your specific setup with **Docker Compose** and the two environments (`development` and `production`):

# Docker - Multiple Deployment Environments

This guide demonstrates how to use **Docker** with Next.js to deploy to **multiple environments** (development and production) using Docker Compose. Each environment has its own `docker-compose.yml` and `Dockerfile`.

## How to Use

### Setting Up the Project

If you haven't already set up your Next.js project, you can do so by running one of the following commands:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-next-app
# or
yarn create next-app my-next-app
# or
pnpm create next-app my-next-app
```

Once the project is created, navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd my-next-app
```

Next, follow the steps below to set up your **Docker** environments.

---

## Docker Environments

In this setup, we have **two environments**:

* **Development**: For testing during development.
* **Production**: For the live environment used by users.

Each environment has its own configuration files:

* `/docker/development/docker-compose.yml`
* `/docker/development/Dockerfile`
* `/docker/production/docker-compose.yml`
* `/docker/production/Dockerfile`

### Running the Development Environment

To build and start the development environment using Docker Compose, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `docker/development` folder:

   ```bash
   cd /docker/development
   ```

2. Run Docker Compose to build and start the containers for the development environment:

   ```bash
   docker compose up --build
   ```

3. Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to view the application.

### Running the Production Environment

To build and start the production environment using Docker Compose, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `docker/production` folder:

   ```bash
   cd /docker/production
   ```

2. Run Docker Compose to build and start the containers for the production environment:

   ```bash
   docker compose up --build
   ```

3. Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:3003](http://localhost:3003) to view the application in production mode.

## Running Locally Without Docker

If you'd like to run the application **without Docker** on your local machine, you can do so by running the Next.js development server directly:

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

2. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Docker Compose Files Structure

#### **Development Docker Compose** (`/docker/development/docker-compose.yml`)

This file contains the configuration for running the Next.js application in the **development** environment. It uses the `Dockerfile` in the same folder.

#### **Production Docker Compose** (`/docker/production/docker-compose.yml`)

This file contains the configuration for running the Next.js application in the **production** environment. It uses the `Dockerfile` in the same folder and typically sets environment variables for production.

---

### Notes on `docker-compose.yml`

* **`docker compose up --build`**: This command builds the Docker images and starts the containers.
* **Development Configuration**: In the development environment, the application is typically set up for live reloading (e.g., `next dev` mode), which allows you to see changes instantly while developing.
* **Production Configuration**: In the production environment, you would typically run the application using `next start` after building the app (`next build`), with optimizations for performance and security.

---

## Conclusion

With Docker Compose, managing different environments for your Next.js application is made simple. You can easily switch between the development and production environments by using the respective `docker-compose.yml` files and their associated configurations. Docker ensures a consistent environment for your application across different stages of development and production.
