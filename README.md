## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

* Node.js >= 18.x
* Yarn (preferred) or npm
* Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sayyat/next-i18n-auth.git
   cd next-i18n-auth
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:

   ```env
   AUTH_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3001
   AUTH_SECRET=<Your Auth Secret>
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=<Your API URL>
   API_URL=<Your API URL>
   NODE_ENV=development
   NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1
   RAPIDAPI_KEY=<Your RapidAPI key>
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

   The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## File Structure

You can find the file structure of the project in the [File Structure](./docs/file-structure.md) document.

## How to Use

### Authentication

* **Sign Up**: Use the `register` modal to create a new account. The backend API handles user registration and returns
  access and refresh tokens.
* **Log In**: Use the `login` modal to authenticate users. Tokens are stored securely, and JWT is decoded for user
  details.

### Localization
* The project uses `i18next` for localization. See [i18next](https://www.i18next.com/) for more details.
* The localization process is fully automated. See [Automation](./docs/automation.md) for more details.
![Translation process](public/assets/generate-translations-log.png)
* Full autocomplete for namespaces and translation keys thanks to auto type generation
![i18n Autocomplete Preview](./public/assets/autocomplete.png)
* Supported languages: `Kazakh`, `English`, and `Russian`.
* Language can be changed using the dropdown in the header.
![Language dropdown](./public/assets/language-dropdown.png)

### Toast Notifications

* Feedback is provided using `react-toastify`.
* Example: Error messages during authentication or form validation feedback.

### Zod Validation

* Zod is used for client-side schema validation for forms.
* Errors are displayed with translations based on the current locale.

---

## Customization

### Add New Languages

1. **Add the new language key in `i18n/lib/config.ts`:**
   To add French (`fr`), update the `languages` array as follows:

   ```typescript
   export const languages = ["kk", "ru", "en", "fr"] as const;
   ```

2. **Generate language files for the new locale:**
   Run `gulp` or `yarn g` command to generate the template language files for the newly added language (`fr` in this
   case).

3. **Translate the new language files:**
   To translate the language files using RapidAPI, run the following command:

   ```bash
   gulp generate-translations -l fr
   ```

   Or use the alias:

   ```bash
   yarn g:trs -l fr
   ```

   That's it! Your new language should now be added to the system.
> **Note:** See [Automation](./docs/automation.md) for more details..

### Add New Pages

1. Create a new folder under the `app` directory, e.g., `app/dashboard`.
2. Add a new `page.tsx` file inside the folder.
3. Use the existing components for layout and styles.

## üöÄ Running Tests

This project includes a robust testing setup to ensure code quality and application reliability. Below are the details
for running different types of tests:

### 1. **Unit and Integration Tests**

We use **Vitest** with **React Testing Library** to write and run unit and integration tests.

#### Run Unit/Integration Tests:

```bash
  yarn test
```

#### Watch Tests:

```bash
  yarn test:watch
```

#### Coverage Report:

```bash
   yarn coverage
```

---

### 2. **End-to-End (E2E) Tests**

We use **Playwright** for writing end-to-end tests.

#### Run E2E Tests:

```bash
  yarn test:e2e
```

#### Playwright Test Runner UI:

```bash
  yarn test:e2e --ui
```

### Notes:

* Ensure the application is running locally before starting E2E tests.
* Configure environment variables in `.env.test` for test-specific setups.

---

### 3. **Test Setup**

* **Unit Testing Framework**: [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)
* **E2E Testing Framework**: [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/)
* **Component Testing**: [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)

#### Test Directory Structure

* Unit tests: `src/` (next to each component)
* E2E tests: `src/tests/e2e/`

---

### Example Test Command:

```bash
  yarn test  # Runs all unit and integration tests
  yarn test:e2e  # Runs all E2E tests
```
